                            <p>I had a lot of fun doing this project. The client did not give much information about how he wants the site to look like, so I just go off my creativity.</p>
                            <p>His logo is very good, it's simple and has a lot of characters in it. Therefore, I just went off the idea from his logo, made the site with sharp edges and wide cta boxes. He also wanted to have an SVG map, so I just sketched the SVG map, and added in hover effect with jQuery, to have the area lighted up when user hover to the shape or the area's name.</p>
                            <p>It was a fairly easy project. The client was very happy with the site, and he went live with it very soon after I'm done with the site. </p>

                            <p>This is one of my most difficult project. The original developer of the site made a very good design in my opinion, but the client was not happy with it at all. I took over this project in hope that we can make the client happy.</p>
                            <p>The site has a lot of going back and forth for revision and changes, multiple comps were given from the client to get every pixel right. However, I actually like the simple, elegant and clean look of the site. It doesn't really seems like a real estate site, but it's different.</p>

I garther all of the most common request from clients, and make sure they can work well together. There are several things that I want to make sure that my websites should have:
                        1. Easy to follow
                        2. Look good, but the good look shouldn't make the website less useful.
                        3. Homepage needs to show all of the core information, but don't put too much
                        4. Even when I have to put a lot of information on the homepage, it needs to look as clean as possible
                        5. MUST breakdown correctly on different devices
